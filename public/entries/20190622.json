Today I just went to downtown Kyoto and walked around, and just went to whatever appeared before my eyes. So I'll just upload the pictures of where I went / what I ate, and call it a day. Really had 0 plan for the day."

It started raining suddenly and I didn't bring my umbrella because it wasn't supposed to rain, but luckily I was right next to an umbrella store, and picked myself up a nice and pretty umbrella. After getting to my ryokan, I had a dinner of sukiyaki. It was really good, in fact too good as my stomach later gave me the favor of seeing my food once again at 6 in the morning. I think the whole meal was just too rich with high quality fatty meat, and I just ate a lot of food, so I couldn't digest it all. Other than that, my stay at the ryokan was really great, and it marks the end of my stay in Kyoto."
