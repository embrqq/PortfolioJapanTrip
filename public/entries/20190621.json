If you don't know what Ryokan are, I recommend looking at my info page and googling about them. They are very interesting Japanese inns, known for hospitality and Kyoto has some of the best. I came before check-in time, so I had to do something to distract myself until then, so just strolled the streets near the Ryokan for a couple hours and found myself in a temple and a shrine with attached garden."

I don't have a picture of me wearing it, but you can google them to get an idea. It's just a plain cotton garb, and it's comfortable to wear after taking a bath. Once I got that put on it was time for my dinner, kaiseki ryori. Kaisek ryori is a traditional Japanese multicourse meal using seasonal ingredients. There were a few parts that were less than appetizing for me, but I managed to get nearly everything down, and the only thing stopping me was being too full at the end. The staff were super nice, each time they came in with a new plate they would ask me a couple questions and ask how the food was, and several times explaining \"Even some Japanese people have trouble with this so it's ok if you can't eat it!\" and \"How is everything? Are you able to eat it?\", and they were surprised when I finished nearly all the plates. I dropped my tea on myself at the end, but luckily there was already a spare yukata in the closet, and they didn't make a big deal of the cushion that I was sitting on getting a little dirty. It was a pretty fun experience."
