I had wanted to try one, but it was definitely not a place that I could go to alone, so I was glad that he offered to take me there. We went to Maidreamin which is a major maid cafe chain, and it was a bit overwhelming but pretty fun. They bring your food and make you participate in little charms/spells. Probably to people who don't watch anime, none of this makes sense, but if you do then you'll know what's going on."
